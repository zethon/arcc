## Introduction

`arcc` is another console app for reading Reddit. Unlike the others, this one is written in C++, so what does that mean?

* **NO** Javascript modules to install
* **NO** `npm`, `brew`, `someotherthirdpartytool` to download
* **NO** meta-software to instal

`arcc` does not depend on "Python v5.19 and higher but not v5.21 because of an incompatibility with version 2.13 of the `Widget` module unless you have the `such-and-such` library installed. **NONE of that.** Simply:

1. Download the installer.
1. Run the installer.
1. Run the program

That's all you need to do to start using Redding from a console!
