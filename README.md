# Another Reddit Console Client (`arcc`)

## Introduction

`arcc` is another console app for reading Reddit. Unlike the others, this one is written in C++, so what does that mean?

* **NO** Javascript modules to install
* **NO** language interpreters to install 
* **NO** `npm`, `brew`, `someotherthirdpartytool` to download

`arcc` does not depend on Python v5.19 and higher but not v5.21 because of an incompatibility with version 2.13 of the `Widget` module. NONE of that. 

1. Download the installer.
1. Run the installer.
1. Run the program

And then you're ready to star using Redding from a console!
